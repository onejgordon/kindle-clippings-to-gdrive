found evidence that VWFA is actually tracking something even more abstract than visual word form. It appears to be tracking word form regardless of the modality of the transducing stream. Thus, the very same area is activated in congenitally blind subjects during Braille reading. The fact that the early input here is tactile rather than visual makes no difference to the recruitment of VWFA. This supports the idea (Pascual-Leone & Hamilton, 2001) of such brain areas as ‘metamodal operators’ that are ‘defined by a given computation that is applied regardless of the sensory input received’. This fits neatly, as Reich et al. (2011, p. 365) themselves note, with the PP image in which higher levels of the cortical hierarchy learn to track the ‘hidden causes’ that account for, and hence predict, the sensory consequences of distal states of affairs. Reich et al. speculate that much activity in VWFA might thus reflect modality-transcending predictions about the sensory consequences of words. VWFA, that is to say, seems to be generating top-down predictions using modality-transcending models of word-hood. The meta-modality of VWFA would then ‘explain its ability to apply top-down predictions to both visual and tactile stimuli’ (Reich et al., 2011, p. 365).

at the very moment where the first missing chirp should have occurred, the system generated a transient (illusory) percept. This percept (the systemic best-guess at the state of the world) was not strong, but the timing was correct with respect to the missing chirp. In other words, the network first dimly ‘perceived’ (imagined) the missing chirp, before responding with a strong error signal as soon as the actual absence of such a signal became apparent

Remarkably, each classifier worked for the other condition. In other words, it was possible to use the ‘imagery decoder’ to classify a currently viewed item, and the ‘percept decoder’ to classify a merely imagined item. This suggests that the two tasks are not simply sharing coarse neural resources, but are sharing the fine-grained use of those resources too.

Assigning a low precision to prediction errors calculated for the early (high spatial and temporal resolution) stages of processing means that no systemic effort is expended upon bringing those states into line with downward-flowing predictions. Under such conditions, it seems plausible that the system would generate a stable percept that simply ignores lower-level details, entraining them (by upping the relevant precision-weightings) only when the task demands.

During exposure, the subject’s pupils responded in the usual fashion, by dilating (widening) when the images were darker, and shrinking when they were lighter. When asked to imagine the same triangles, the same pupillary responses of dilation and shrinkage occurred. This result is striking since pupil size is something over which most subjects cannot exercise any form of conscious control, leading the experimenters to comment that ‘the observed pupillary adjustments to imaginary light present a strong case for accounts of mental imagery as a process based on brain states similar to those that arise in perception’ (p. 188).

The core idea (Friston, Daunizeau, et al., 2010) is thus that there are two ways in which biological agents can reduce prediction error. The first (as seen in Part I) involves finding the predictions that best accommodate the current sensory inputs. The second is by performing actions that make our predictions come true—for example, moving around and sampling the world so as to generate or discover the very perceptual patterns that we predict.

whenever a monkey performs a grasping action with visual guidance, the activation of motor neurons (involved in the performance of grasping) and visual neurons (involved in the visual guidance of grasping) is correlated. Through associative learning, this correlated activation gives the grasping motor neurons additional, matching properties; they become mirror neurons, firing not only when grasping is executed, but also when it is observed.

The solution, once again, may lie in the canny (learnt) deployment of precision-weighting. Suppose we again lower the weighting on (select aspects of) the proprioceptive error signal, while simultaneously entering a high-level neural state whose rough-and-ready folk-psychological gloss might be something like ‘the cup is grasped’. Motor action is entrained by high-precision proprioceptive expectations and cannot here ensue. But here too, all the other intertwined elements in the generative model remain poised to act in the usual way. The result should be a ‘mental simulation’ of the reach and an appreciation of its most likely consequences. Such mental simulations provide an appealing way of smoothing the path from basic forms of embodied response to abilities of planning, deliberation, and ‘offline reflection’.

A layer composed of singe cells is limited to predicting one step ahead. To see why, note that at any time, there is information about the current input, represented by the pattern of firing cells, and also information about what the layer predicts will come next, represented by the pattern of predictive depolarisation in cells connected to the current pattern. Conversely, the predictive pattern is based on information only one step in the past, and the layer can’t learn to distinguish between different sequences where the difference is two or more steps in the past. Thus it “forgets” any context which is more than one time step old.

When we (as native speakers) encounter such a sound stream, we hear a sequence of words, separated by gaps. The sound stream itself, however, is perfectly continuous, as a spectrogram quite dramatically reveals. Those gaps are added by the listener. What we encounter in perception is in that sense a construct. But it is a construct that tracks real structure in the signal source (other agents producing strings of distinct meaningful words). The predictive brain here lets us see through the noisy, sensory signal to uncover the humanly relevant aspects of the world giving rise to the waves of sensory stimulation. This may be a rather good picture of what perception, on the PP model, quite generally does.

The taxing experience in autism (cf. sensory overload) may result from a perceptual system that continuously signals prediction errors, indicating that there always remains something to be learnt still and that attentional resources are needed. The accompanying negative feelings could cause these patients to avoid the most variable or unpredictable situations where context-dependent high-level predictions are more important than concrete perceptual details. This may be the case for social interaction in particular. The overwhelming prediction errors cause these patients (or their caregivers) to externalize and enforce predictability through exact routines and patterns in their daily activities.

Seligman and Maier divided the dogs into three groups. The dogs in the first group were placed in a harness and administered an electric shock but were also given a lever they could press to make the shock stop. The dogs in the second group were placed in an identical harness and were given the same lever, and the same shock, with one catch: the lever didn’t work, rendering the dog powerless to do anything about the electric shock. The third group of dogs were simply placed in the harness and not given any shocks.1 Afterwards, each dog was placed in a large box with a low divider across the center. One side of the box produced an electric shock; the other did not. Then something interesting happened. The dogs that either had been able to stop the shock or had not been shocked at all in the earlier part of the experiment quickly learned to step over the divider to the side without shocks. But the dogs that had been powerless in the last part of the experiment did not. These dogs didn’t adapt or adjust. They did nothing to try to avoid getting shocked. Why? They didn’t know they had any choice other than to take the shocks. They had learned helplessness.

By dropping the larynx low in the neck, humans lost the tube within a tube and developed a big common space behind the tongue through which food and air both travel to get into either the esophagus or the trachea. As a result, food sometimes gets lodged in the back of the throat, blocking off the airway. Humans are the only species that risks asphyxiation when we swallow something too large or imprecisely.

How does the uniquely shaped human vocal tract with equally long horizontal and vertical portions affect our speech? A vocal tract with two tubes of equal length produces vowels whose frequencies are more distinct and which require less precision to make properly.50 In effect, the human configuration allows you to be a little sloppy when speaking yet still produce discrete vowels that your listener will recognize correctly without having to rely on context.

Other, nonexclusive hypotheses are that modern humans outcompeted our cousins because we were better at cooperating, that we foraged and hunted for a wider range of resources, including more fish and fowl, and that we had larger, more effective social networks.

if there is any special adaptation of modern humans that accounts for our evolutionary success (so far) it must be our ability to be adaptable because of our extraordinary capacities to communicate, cooperate, think, and invent.

However, it is possible that we are sometimes so effective at treating a mismatch disease’s symptoms that we reduce the urgency of treating its causes. I suspect this is the case for cavities, and later chapters will explore the effects of treating symptoms for other novel diseases.

The capacity for bodies to adjust their observable characteristics (their phenotype) in response to environmental stresses is formally known as phenotypic plasticity. All organisms require phenotypic plasticity to grow and function, and the more biologists look, the more examples they discover.

To sum up, we really did evolve to “use it or lose it.” Because bodies are not engineered but instead grow and evolve, your body expects and indeed requires certain stresses when you are maturing in order to develop appropriately. Such interactions are widely appreciated in the brain: if you deprive a child of language or social interactions his or her brain will never develop properly, and the best time to learn a new language or the violin is when you are young. Similarly important interactions also characterize other systems that interact intensively with the outside world, such as your immune system and the organs that help you digest food, maintain a stable body temperature, and more.

In contrast, if you load a bone a lot during development, it will grow thicker, hence stronger. Tennis players’ arms illustrate this principle nicely. People who played lots of tennis as youngsters have bones in their dominant, racket-swinging arm that are up to 40 percent thicker and stronger than in their other arm.7 Other studies show that children who run and walk more develop thicker leg bones, and children who chew harder, tougher food develop thicker jaw bones.8 No strain, no gain.

The original hygiene hypothesis is that since people were constantly fighting off mild infections for much of human history, their immune systems were always moderately busy with bacteria and viruses, limiting the number of T-helper 2 cells. Ever since bleach, sterilization, and antibiotic soaps made our environments more germ-free, children’s immune systems have had more unemployed T-helper 2 cells swimming about, increasing the likelihood that one of them will make a terrible mistake and wrongly target a harmless substance as an enemy. Once this happens, an allergy develops.

Just as not requiring a child to reason critically will stunt her intellect, not stressing a child’s bones, muscles, and immune systems will fail to match these organs’ capacities to their demands.

Humans are also marvelously adapted to make and use tools, to communicate effectively, to cooperate intensively, to innovate, and to use culture to cope with a wide range of challenges. These extraordinary cultural capacities enabled Homo sapiens to spread rapidly across the planet and then, paradoxically, cease being hunter-gatherers.

For example, we consistently discount the value of rewards in the present (such as one more cookie) relative to rewards in the distant future (such as health during old age) in proportion to the length of the delay. These and other unhealthy instincts are presumably ancient adaptations that used to benefit the chances of surviving and having more offspring during times of scarcity, and it is only recently that they have become perversely adaptive in an environment of plenty. Put differently, we constantly make irrational decisions through no fault of our own. These natural tendencies then make us vulnerable to manufacturers and marketers who easily exploit our basic urges to eat too much, eat the wrong foods, and exercise too little. Because these unhealthy behaviors are deep instincts they are very difficult to overcome.

humans did not always evolve to choose to behave in ways that promoted health but instead were coerced by nature. Put differently, an evolutionary perspective suggests that we sometimes need help from external forces in order to help ourselves.

Just as cultural innovations have caused many of these mismatch diseases, other cultural innovations can also help us prevent them. Doing so will take a mixture of science, education, and intelligent collective action.

Another reason it would be a good invention is that there are so many times when you know you're feeling a lot of something, but you don't know what the something is. Am I frustrated? Am I actually just panicky? And that confusion changes your mood, it becomes your mood, and you become a confused, gray person. But with the special water, you could look at your orange hands and think, I'm happy! That whole time I was actually happy! What a relief!

Hora’s watches were no less complex than those of Tempus, but he put together stable subassemblies of about ten elements each. Then he put ten of these subassemblies together into a larger assembly; and ten of those assemblies constituted the whole watch. Whenever Hora had to put down a partly completed watch to answer the phone, he lost only a small part of his work. So he made his watches much faster and more efficiently than did Tempus. Complex systems can evolve from simple systems only if there are stable intermediate forms. The resulting complex forms will naturally be hierarchic. That may explain why hierarchies are so common in the systems nature presents to us. Among all possible complex forms, hierarchies are the only ones that have had the time to evolve.5 Paraphrased from Herbert Simon,

The trouble . . . is that we are terrifyingly ignorant. The most learned of us are ignorant. . . . The acquisition of knowledge always involves the revelation of ignorance—almost is the revelation of ignorance.

Everything, as they say, is connected to everything else, and not neatly. There is no clearly determinable boundary between the sea and the land, between sociology and anthropology, between an automobile’s exhaust and your nose. There are only boundaries of word, thought, perception, and social agreement—artificial, mental-model boundaries.

Bounded rationality means that people make quite reasonable decisions based on the information they have. But they don’t have perfect information, especially about more distant parts of the system. Fishermen don’t know how many fish there are, much less how many fish will be caught by other fishermen that same day.

We don’t even interpret perfectly the imperfect information that we do have, say behavioral scientists. We misperceive risk, assuming that some things are much more dangerous than they really are and others much less. We live in an exaggerated present—we pay too much attention to recent experience and too little attention to the past, focusing on current events rather than long term behavior. We discount the future at rates that make no economic or ecological sense. We don’t give all incoming signals their appropriate weights. We don’t let in at all news we don’t like, or information that doesn’t fit our mental models. Which is to say, we don’t even make decisions that optimize our own individual good, much less the good of the system as a whole.
